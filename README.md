# Task 04: Sentiment Analysis and Visualization of Social Media Data
This project involves analyzing and visualizing sentiment patterns in social media data to understand public opinion and attitudes towards specific topics or brands. By applying sentiment analysis techniques, we aim to uncover insights into how people feel about particular topics, which can be valuable for businesses, marketers, and researchers.

# Dataset
Source: Kaggle - Twitter Entity Sentiment Analysis Dataset Description: This dataset consists of tweets labeled with sentiment scores and other relevant metadata. It provides information on public sentiments expressed on social media, which can be used to analyze attitudes toward specific topics or brands over time.
